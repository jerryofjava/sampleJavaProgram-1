# sampleJavaProgram-1
A sample Java program that uses the System.in to take the number of array entries, and the array of numbers to compute for the minimum absolute difference among the array entries

Example Input:
3
123

Output:
1

Because, 1-2=1 which is the minimum absolute difference; can also be 2-1=1
Where:

3 <--Number of array entries
123 <--Array {1,2,3}
1 <--Minimum absolute difference among the arrays (output)
